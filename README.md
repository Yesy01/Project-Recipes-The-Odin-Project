This project is being done with the sole aim of learning the JS skill. I am however completing 2 course to achieve this goal. So far I have learnt HTML basics (Brushed up my skills mostly as i already knew HTML but this exercise has helped me revisit it and strengthen my knowledge). I will put the following to test in HTML: Elements/basic HTML tags, Images, List, and Hyperlinks. I should add on to this as the course progresses.
