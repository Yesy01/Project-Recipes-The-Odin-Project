        Bread Crumbs Topping.
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            2 tablespoons salted butter
        </li>
        <li>
            ½ cup dry bread crumbs
        </li>
         <li>
            1 pinch ground paprika

        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
        Directions
    </h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Step 1</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square baking dish.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Step 2</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Make the macaroni and cheese: Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add macaroni and simmer, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; it will finish cooking in the oven. Drain and transfer to the prepared baking dish.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Step 3</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        While the macaroni is cooking, melt 1/4 cup butter in a medium skillet over low heat. Whisk in flour and stir until the mixture becomes paste-like and light golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Step 4</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Gradually whisk 2 1/2 cups milk into the flour mixture, and bring to a simmer. Stir in shredded Cheddar and finely grated Parmesan cheeses; season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir over low heat until cheese is melted and sauce has thickened, 3 to 5 minutes, adding up to 1/2 cup more milk if needed. Pour cheese sauce over macaroni and stir until well combined.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Step 5</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Make the bread crumb topping: Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add bread crumbs; cook and stir until well coated and browned. Spread bread crumbs over macaroni and cheese, then sprinkle with paprika.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Step 6</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Bake in the preheated oven until topping is golden brown and macaroni and cheese is bubbling, about 30 minutes.
