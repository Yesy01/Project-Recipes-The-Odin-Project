    <h1>Air-fried Sweet Potatoes</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Use your air fryer to make these yummy sweet potato chips. After much experimenting I found that the best chips came from a mandoline that was set just a hair thicker than 1/16 inch (about 3/32 inch thick).    </p>

        Directions
    </h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Step 1</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Slice potato into 1/16-inch-thick rounds using a mandoline. Put potato slices in a large bowl of cold water; soak about 20 minutes. Drain and pat dry with paper towels. Wipe out bowl.

    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Step 2</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Return potato slices to dried bowl. Add oil, salt, and pepper; toss gently to coat.


    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Step 3</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Preheat air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly coat air fryer basket with cooking spray. Working in batches if needed, arrange potato slices in an even layer in basket (do not overcrowd).

    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Step 4</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Cook until lightly golden and crispy, 12 to 16 minutes, turning and rearranging chips into an even layer every 4 minutes. Watch closely during the last 2 to 3 minutes of cooking. Check chips about every 30 seconds, using tongs to remove golden chips from the basket as needed to avoid overcooking and ending up with bitter chips.

    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Step 5</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Let chips cool about 5 minutes. Chips will continue to crisp as they cool.Store in an airtight container up to 3 days.
